  - Create a bar graph of workshop participants by month by **selecting A3:A7** and then **hold down your ctrl key** (or **command key** on a Mac) and **select C3:C7**.
  - Next, **select** the **Insert tab** at the top of the screen, and then **click** on **Recommended Charts**. The default bar chart should work fine, so **click OK**. Click on the Chart Title and rename it to **Participants**.<br>
