# Charting, Graphs and More with Excel
In this activity, you will produce some graphs and charts in Excel. If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this in-class exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

1. Let’s start by getting a new spreadsheet setup. 
  - At the very bottom of the spreadsheet, beside the **Sheet 1** tab, click on the **+** button to create a new sheet.
  - Enter the following information into the new sheet:
 <img src="images/excel-charts-graphs-02.png" alt="Enter the following information into the sheet: colum A: workshop, twine, sketchnoting, academic posters, 3d print, dsc intro. In colum B: Workshops, 3, 3, 1, 2 and 1. In column C: people, 58, 58, 46, 45, 29.">

2. **Sorting**: Sort by the number of workshops held (column B): 
  - Click on cell **A1** and drag your mouse to **C6**, highlighting all boxes
  - Click on the green **Data** tab on the top menu.
  - Click on the **Sort** button on the top menu (see right). Note: If the sort Filter button is not visible, increase the size of your Excel window so that more tools are displayed on the ribbon.
  - A dialogue box will pop up. Click on the **Column** drop-down, and select **Workshops**.
  - Click on the **Order** drop-down and select **Largest to Smallest**. 
Press OK and the spreadsheet will re-order so that the workshop list is reordered from most to least number of workshops held.

4. **Freezing rows or Columns**: This is particularly useful on spreadsheets with a lot of data so that you can scroll vertically and horizontally and still see your column and row labels.
